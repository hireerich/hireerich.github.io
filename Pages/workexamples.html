					<h1 class="titleHeader">Java: Pong Game</h1>

					<p>During the second semester of my first year at COGS, I was given an assignment to create a 'Pong Game'.
					This game would have a ball which is hit back and forth by paddles, with a count of how many times the ball hit
					a paddle without going out of bounds.
					</br></br>
					The Project required the game to have a menu to select 'Play Game', and also to view previously acheived 'High Scores'
					which were to be saved to the system and retreived when needed. Once I had written the code for the base game I decided
					to design the game with inspiration from the classic game 'Pong' which used a simple white on black theme.</p>

					<h1 class="titleHeader">Java: Vehicles Project</h1>

					<p>In my Advanced OOP course I was tasked with creating a class heirarchy of vehicles. This would have a base class
					containing all similar attributes between vehicle types. Then new types of vehicles would be created with unique controls
					depending on their type.
					</br></br>
					This Project was built on throughout the entire course, each assignment adding a new feature to the Project.
					The vehicles collide with eachother, are able to be controlled, can be added and removed, are saved to a database when
					the program is closed and retreived when it is opened and run on a server so that multiple clients may add and remove vehicles.</p>

					<h1 class="titleHeader">JS: Matchstick Game</h1>

					<p>This is a project from my Web Application Programming course. Here I was tasked with creating a game of matchsticks
					with selectable matches and two players. This was to be done using JavaScript.
					</br></br>
					The sticks were to be arranged in a pyramid and start with transparent background. Then upon being selected have a red
					background. Then once the player completed their move, the selected matches would have a grey background and be
					unable to be selected for the remainder of the game.</p>
